# SPARQL

For this assignment you will write a series of SPARQL queries. You'll use an interactive SPARQL query interface to develop each query, and then copy and paste it into a file to check that it is correct.

## Instructions

The questions are lettered `A` through `R`. Later questions build upon earlier ones. In many cases you can answer a question by modifying the query for the previous question.

For each question there is a corresponding SPARQL query file with the suffix `.rq`, for example `A.rq`. The initial contents of each query file contain prefixes and the selected variable names to get you started. Use the contents as a starting point for developing and testing your query in the interactive SPARQL query interface.

Once you have a query that you think works, copy and paste it into query file.

To check if the query in `A.rq` is valid SPARQL, run:

```
make A.valid
```

If the query in `A.rq` is not valid SPARQL, you'll get an error.

To run the query in `A.rq` and put the results in `A-actual.csv`, run:

```
make A-actual.csv
```

To check if results of the `A.rq` query are correct, run:

```
make A.correct
```

If the results are not correct, you'll see an error like 

```diff
--- A-actual.csv	2022-10-29 21:45:38.000000000 -0400
+++ A-expect.csv	2022-10-29 11:45:56.000000000 -0400

 uri
-
+http://n2t.net/ark:/39333/ncg/place/NCG03092
gmake: *** [Makefile:52: A.correct] Error 1
```

The green lines starting with `+` are the expected (correct) results. The red lines starting with `-` are the actual (incorrect) results.

### Skipping questions

If you want to skip a question, run:

```
make A.skipped
```

(Replace `A` with the letter of the question you wish to skip.)

If you change your mind about skipping questions, run:

```
make clean
```

### Submitting the assignment

To submit the assignment, run:

```
make submission.zip
```

Then submit the zip file at 
https://aeshin.org/teaching/assignment/210/submit/

Finally, you should [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-source-control-in-your-codespace#committing-your-changes) and [push](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-source-control-in-your-codespace#pushing-changes-to-your-remote-repository) the following files:

* all the files ending with `.rq`
* `description.ttl` (see [part 3](#3-constructing-dublin-core-triples) of the assignment)

## 1 Querying the NC Gazetteer

For questions A‚ÄìK, use the NC Gazetteer query interface:
https://jena-fuseki.fly.dev/#/dataset/ncg/query

A. In the NC Gazetteer dataset, the predicate `skos:prefLabel` is used to associate place URIs and place names. What is the URI for the place named ‚ÄúChoggy Butte Mountain‚Äù? 

B. List the predicate and the object of every triple that has the place named ‚ÄúChoggy Butte Mountain‚Äù in the subject position. The list should be sorted alphabetically by predicate, then by object.

C. What is the name of the county that Choggy Butte Mountain is in? (Try to write this query without using the URI of the county.)

D. List the name of every place that is in the same county as Choggy Butte Mountain. The list should be sorted alphabetically.

E. List the URI and the name of every place that has ‚Äúbutt‚Äù (capitalized or uncapitalized) somewhere in its name. The list should be sorted alphabetically by name, then by URI.

F. List the URI of each unique predicate used in the dataset. The list should be sorted alphabetically.

G. In the NC Gazetteer dataset, the predicate `dcterms:type` is used to associate place URIs and place types. List the URI of each unique type (value of `dcterms:type`) used in the dataset.  The list should be sorted alphabetically.

H. List the URI and the name of every creek in Orange County. The list should be sorted alphabetically by name.

I. List the URI and name of every creek in Orange County or Chatham County, along with the name of the county the creek is in. The list should be sorted alphabetically by county name, then by creek name.

J. List the URI and the name of every creek in Orange County or Chatham County, and if it has a `geojson:geometry` value associated with it, list that as well. The list should be sorted alphabetically by county name, then by creek name.

K. List the URI and the name of every creek in Orange County or Chatham County that does **not** have a `geojson:geometry` value associated with it. The list should be sorted alphabetically by county name, then by creek name.

## 2 Querying Wikidata

For questions L‚ÄìQ, use the Wikidata query interface:‚Ä®
https://query.wikidata.org

Remember that you‚Äôll want to include the following clause in your query to get English-language labels for things:

```
SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" . }
```

Read about [how the the label service works](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual#Label_service).

L. List the URI and the English label of every [stream](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q47521) in [Orange County](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q507957). The list should be ordered alphabetically by label.

M. List the URI and the English label of every [watercourse](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q355304) in Orange County, along with the URI and the English label of of the specific type of watercourse it is. The list should be ordered alphabetically by watercourse label.

N. List the URI and the English label of of every [swamp](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q166735) in [North Carolina](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1454). The list should be sorted alphabetically by label, then by URI.

O. List the URI, English label, elevation, and [coordinate location](http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P625) of the ten swamps in North Carolina having the highest [elevation above sea level](http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P2044). The list should be ordered by elevation from highest to lowest. (Try switching to the map view after running your query‚Äîuse the üëÅ icon on left above your list of results in the Wikidata query interface.)

P. List the URI, English label and number of swamps of every [county of North Carolina](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13414758) having at least 50 swamps. The list should be ordered alphabetically by label.

Q. List the URI, English label and number of swamps for all 100 counties in North Carolina. The list should be ordered by number of swamps from most to least, then alphabetically by label.

## 3 CONSTRUCTing Dublin Core triples

R. For this question you will write a `CONSTRUCT` query that constructs new triples based on the triples in your `description.ttl` file from the previous assignment. The new triples will use properties from the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) instead of the properties you defined. 

Look at the DCMI Metadata Terms (specifically, the properties in the `/terms/` namespace), and find two or three properties that are similar in meaning to properties that you defined. Then write a `CONSTRUCT` query that constructs new triples using the DCMI properties.

Next, add your `description.ttl` file to your assignment repository (just as you did for the previous assignment).

Then run the query to get the results. Because this query produces results as Turtle rather than CSV, instead of running:

```
make R-actual.csv
```

‚Ä¶ you should run:

```
make R-actual.ttl
```
